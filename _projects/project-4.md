**Overview**

This project was conducted as part of the Axiom Space Stars Scholarship, focusing on designing and manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs) for use in microgravity environments. The aim was to investigate how microgravity affects the performance, reliability, and manufacturability of PCBs, which are critical components in space-based electronics.

**Recognition**

This project was selected as a winner in the inaugural [Axiom Space Stars Scholarship](https://www.axiomspace.com/release/axiom-space-reveals-winners-of-inaugural-stars-scholarship-incubating-new-ideas-for-microgravity-research), which supports innovative research ideas for microgravity environments.
