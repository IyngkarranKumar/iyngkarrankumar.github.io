I am incoming [Astra Fellow](https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship), where I'll be working on post-AGI Governance with [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/). Recently, I finished a Masters by Research at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on [emergent abilities in language models at inference time](/projects/project-MSCR) under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). Previously I was a winter fellow and research assistant at [GovAI](https://www.governance.ai/about-us); before that I did my bachelors in physics and computer science. 

I'm interested in the long-term prospects of human civilisation. The future could hold a [tremendously large number of people](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/astronomical-waste/); assuming they live good lives, it seems incredibly important that civilisation steers towards this outcome. However, in the present day there are risks that could have [globally catastrophic consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk), and in the worst-case, lead to the end of civilisation as we know it. The upstream goal of most of my work is trying to better understand and communicate these risks, as well as characterise what good long-term futures look like.

Check out the [Projects](/projects/) page for a list of things that I've worked on.
