**Internal Coherence Maximisation (CIM) Implementation**: \\
A core problem in training smarter-than-human AI systems is providing a reliable feedback signal on the AI's outputs. Human labelling of outputs suffers from being too expensive, and potentially inaccurate for tasks that exceed human ability. [Wen et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139) develop the ICM algorithm to generate labels without human supervision, by choosing the label set that maximises a combination of (a). internal coherence **between the generated label set**, and (b)logical consistency. See [here](https://github.com/IyngkarranKumar/ICM_implementation/tree/main) for my implementation.

**Short write-ups and takes**:
Over the past few years I've done lots of short write-ups on the topics of AI Governance, Safety, and Longtermism (to name a few), with the aim of better understanding key concepts, as well for work tests. I've collected them all in a document here.
