Welcome to my site. I'm currently an MScR student at the University of Edinburgh, studying emergent capabilities in large language models under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). I am also an incoming winter fellow at the [Centre for Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/). Previously, I studied physics and computer science at Durham University. 

I'm fascinated by the long-term prospects of human civilisation. Some basic math shows that the future could contain a tremendously large number of people[^1], and assuming these people live good lives it seems incredibly important that civilisation steers towards this outcome. However, in the present day there are a number of risks that could have globally catastrophic consequences, and in the worst-case, lead to an abrupt ending of civilisation as we know it. Global nuclear warfare and deadly pandemics are ones that are publicly realised, whilst risks from runaway superintelligent computers are still met with significant scepticism. The upstream goal of most of my work at the moment is trying to better understand and characterise these risks.


[^1]: [Bostrom 2003](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/astronomical-waste/) estimates that 10<sup>23</sup> humans could inhabit the Virgo Supercluster. Such large numbers lose a lot of their intuitive meaning, but this is more than the number of grains of sand on Earth (by a small factor of 100,000 !)
