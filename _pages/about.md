Welcome to my site. I'm currently an MScR student at the University of Edinburgh, studying emergent capabilities in large language models under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). I am also an incoming winter fellow at the [Centre for Governance of AI](https://www.governance.ai/). Previously, I studied physics and computer science at Durham University. 

I'm fascinated by the long-term prospects of human civilisation. The future could hold a tremendously large number of people[^1], and assuming they live well it seems incredibly important that civilisation steers towards this outcome. However, in the present day there are a number of risks that could have [globally catastrophic consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk), and in the worst-case, lead to an abrupt ending of civilisation as we know it. The upstream goal of most of my work is trying to better understand and communicate these risks, as well as characterise what good long-term futures look like.
