**Project Overview**

This project explores the development and analysis of functional modules within Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) networks. The aim is to understand how modular structures can enhance reasoning capabilities in neural networks, particularly for tasks that require compositional and abstract visual understanding.

**Key Objectives**
- Investigate the emergence and utility of functional modules in AVR networks.
- Develop methods to identify, isolate, and interpret these modules.
- Evaluate the impact of modularity on generalization and transfer learning in visual reasoning tasks.
