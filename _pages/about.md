Welcome to my site! 

I'm currently an MScR student at the University of Edinburgh, researching emergent abilities during inference-time scaling under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). Previously I was a winter fellow and research assistant at (GovAI)[https://www.governance.ai/about-us], and before that I studied physics and computer science at Durham University. 

I'm interested in the long-term prospects of human civilisation. The future could hold a [tremendously large number of people](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/astronomical-waste/); assuming they live good lives, it seems incredibly important that civilisation steers towards this outcome. However, in the present day there are risks that could have [globally catastrophic consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk), and in the worst-case, lead to the end of civilisation as we know it. The upstream goal of most of my work is trying to better understand and communicate these risks, as well as characterise what good long-term futures look like.

Check out the [Projects](/Projects/) page for a list of things that I've worked on.
