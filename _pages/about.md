I am an [Astra Fellow](https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship),  working on post-AGI Governance with [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/). Recently, I finished a Masters by Research at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on [emergent abilities in language models at inference time](/projects/project-MSCR) under the supervision of [Dr. Edoardo Ponti](https://ducdauge.github.io/). 

I'm interested in the long-term prospects of human civilisation. The future could hold a [tremendously large number of people](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/astronomical-waste/); assuming they live good lives, it seems incredibly important that civilisation steers towards this outcome. However, currently there are risks that could have [globally catastrophic consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk), and in the worst-case, lead to the end of civilisation as we know it. The upstream goal of most of my work is trying to better understand and communicate these risks, as well as characterise what good long-term futures look like. Right now, that means figuring out how to navigate the transition to a world with powerful AI systems.

Check out the [Projects](/projects/) page for a list of things that I've worked on.
