This project was selected as a winner in the inaugural [Axiom Space Stars Scholarship](https://www.axiomspace.com/release/axiom-space-reveals-winners-of-inaugural-stars-scholarship-incubating-new-ideas-for-microgravity-research), which supports innovative research ideas for microgravity environments. My proposal centred around manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs) in low-earth orbit to bypass manufacturing constraints here on Earth.  

Quoting Axiom:
> The printed circuit board (PCB) is the foundation of electronic devices; this project reimagines PCB manufacturing aided by the removal of gravitational forces, allowing for a broader range of production techniques that are not possible on Earth. This could, in turn, result in higher-performing and highly compact PCBs and thus breakthrough impacts on future electronic device development.
