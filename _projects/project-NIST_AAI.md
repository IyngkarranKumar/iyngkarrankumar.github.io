Advancing the field of AI testing and evaluation is a priority for the safe deployment of frontier AI systems. I co-authored a response to NIST’s Request for Information (RFI) as part of the implementation of [Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence). My contributions centred on identifying open research questions for evaluating AI models across their entire life-cycle—including pretraining, fine-tuning, and post-deployment phases.
