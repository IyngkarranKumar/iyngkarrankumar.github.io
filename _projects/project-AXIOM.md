**Overview**

This project was selected as a winner in the inaugural [Axiom Space Stars Scholarship](https://www.axiomspace.com/release/axiom-space-reveals-winners-of-inaugural-stars-scholarship-incubating-new-ideas-for-microgravity-research), which supports innovative research ideas for microgravity environments. My proposal centred around manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs) in low-earth orbit to bypass manufacturing constraints here on Earth.
